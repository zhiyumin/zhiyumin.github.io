<p>I am an Algorithm Engineer at <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/">Alibaba Group</a>. Before joining Alibaba, I worked with <a href="http://dahua.me">Prof. Dahua Lin</a> at <a href="https://www.sensetime.com/">SenseTime</a>. Prior to that, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests broadly lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Recommender System. Generally I am interested in discovering the essence of <em>Learning</em> and exploring its applications.</p>
<p>I will join <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/">Master of Science in Computer Vision, Carnegie Mellon University</a> in this coming fall.</p>
